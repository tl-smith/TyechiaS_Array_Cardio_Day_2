# Array Cardio Day 2
  ## Objective
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Recognize and explain the purpose of common array methods

- Explore array checking methods

- Understand and apply .find() for locating specific elements

- Use .findIndex() for identifying element positions

- Perform element deletion using .findIndex()

Recognize and explain the purpose of common array methods, including:

- some(): used to check if at least one element in the array satisfies a provided condition. It iterates through the array and executes a callback function on each element.
- every(): tests whether all elements in an array pass a provided function's test. It returns true if all elements satisfy the condition and false otherwise.
- find(): used to search for and retrieve the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition. It operates by iterating through the array and applying a callback function to each element. I
- findIndex(): returns the index of the first element of an array that satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns -1 if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition.



These powerful methods will help you write cleaner, more efficient, and more expressive JavaScript.

## Tech Used
- JavaScript

- HTML/CSS

- Browser Console (for testing and output)
